This is the first assessment project for the Udacity's [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)

It requires to utilise the student's HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout and styling.

The project I realised meets the [project specifications](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2667/view) required by Udacity and in particular:

- it provides a **Blog Homepage** and a **Blog Post** which is reachable by clicking on the first article in the homepage
- it uses Flexbox and CSS Grid, which is the main purpose of the exercise
- it contains media queries to make the layout responsible to different devices (mobile, tablet and desktop)

Regarding the extra requirements, the following has been implemented:

- I am using [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) as a design pattern
- I used _Custom Text_ where possible
- I created a couple of related articles in the blog post
- I implemented a form to send comments, and a form to subscribe to the newsletter

As a personal extra I used JQuery, which is provided by Semantic UI, to make the webpage slightly more interactive.

## Tech Stack:

- HTML5 semantic tags
- CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid
- JQuery
- Semantic UI
- Node
- GIT
